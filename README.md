What it can do:
- Create an Array and perform functions as a datatype Maps
- Create a List and perform functions as a datatype Maps
- Runs through a driver program testing all the Maps functions
- Read through greenEggs.txt and count each distinct word

How to build yourself:
- DL [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- CD to maps directory
- run ```go build maps.go```
- remove other executable ```rm maps```
- run ```.\maps.go```
- conversly you can just run ```go run maps.go``` for an instant execution of the program
- I think you may need to set your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) and create a src folder within for go build to work
